#Web Audio Drum Synth
THis is an analog style drum synthesizer written using the web audio api. It has a bunch of tweakable controls but right now the only thing with a gui is some basic triggers. Many more features are planned for the future.

You can try the live version [here](http://devin-dominguez.github.io/Web-Audio-Drum-Synth/).
